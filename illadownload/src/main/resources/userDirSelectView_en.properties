descriptionGeneral=This directory is used to store the user and character related data. Log files, \
  miniature map data and your settings will be stored in this directory.
descriptionAbsoluteRelative=There are two ways to set this directory. The first way is to set an absolute path on the \
  computer that will be used to store the data. The data will be stored there no matter the method used to launch the \
  downloader. The second method is to store the data in a relative directory to the executed JAR-file. This method is \
  handy in case you want to store Illarion on a USB drive and use it on multiple computers.
